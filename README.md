# LGN Jet Autoencoder
This is an autoencoder classifier trained on the hls4ml 150-particle jet dataset.
The architecture (mainly files in `/lgn/cg_lib`, `/lgn/g_lib`, and `/lgn/nn_lib`) is based on [The Lorentz Group Network](https://github.com/fizisist/LorentzGroupNetwork) introduced by Bogatskiy et al. in [arXiv:2006.04780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04780) and its [adaptation](https://github.com/faroukmokhtar/LGN) by Farouk.
