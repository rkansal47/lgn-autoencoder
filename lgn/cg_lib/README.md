# The Clebsch-Gordan Decomposition Library
## Descriptions
The files in this folder define how to find the irreducible representations (irreps) of the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group) from Lorentz tensors (including Lorentz scalars and vectors) or reducible representations written in the basis formed by the [zonal spherical harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonal_spherical_harmonics) using the [Clebsch-Gordan decompositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients), as well as how take the tensor product between two irreps and then find the irreps of the product.

## Main Reference
The content in this folders are cloned from [The Lorentz Group Network](https://github.com/fizisist/LorentzGroupNetwork) introduced by Bogatskiy et al. in [arXiv:2006.04780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04780) (with only *minor* adaptations).
