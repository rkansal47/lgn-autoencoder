# Models
## Descriptions
The files in this directory define the architecture of the Lorentz Group Network (LGN) Autoencoder. The encoder is defined as `LGNEncoder` in `encoder.py`, and the decoder as `LGNEncoder` in `encoder.py`.

## Main Reference
The neural network architectures in `lgn_cg.py` and `lgn_levels.py` were cloned from [The Lorentz Group Network](https://github.com/fizisist/LorentzGroupNetwork) introduced by Bogatskiy et al. in [arXiv:2006.04780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04780) with minor adaptations.
